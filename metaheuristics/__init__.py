"""The metaheuristics package is used to solve optimization problems using
a set of well known metaheuristics.  Heuristics are a set of techniques that
seek optimal or near-optimal solutions at a reasonable optimization cost.
Metaheuristics are heuristics that are inspired by nature and are not
problem-specific
