Metaheuristics
==============

This is a collection of metahueristic algorithms for optimization problems.

I took the examples from the udemy course [Optimization with Metaheuristics in Python](https://www.udemy.com/optimization-with-metaheuristics/) by `Dana Knight`. However, all code and documentation is my own
